# iCRF Generator Roadmap
While we aim to improve the tool, please note that implementation of new features may depend on available funding.

## To be investigated further - Requested by Users
- Look into CDISC eCRF Portal as source (perhaps https://www.cdisc.org/cdisc-library/api-documentation#/)
- Add support for linkml

## To be investigated further
- Code signing to, hopefully, alleviate some of the security issues
- Check whether it is necessary to add support for new ART-DECOR 
- Add scaling to better support higher / lower resolutions
- Add support for Repeating Groups for some of the EDCs
- Check whether it makes sense to remove the default defaultiCRFSettings from the resources to allow it to be updated more easily
- Add option to make a ZIP file of the cached codebooks available for download
- Add a new page which allows the user to give the CRF a name, etc.
- Add support for Research Manager EDC

## Finished!
- Add support for CDISC ODM (NWO-funded)
- Make it possible to more easily add new codebook sources (NWO-funded)
- Add support for OpenEHR as a codebook source (NWO-funded)
- Improve UI for codebooks selection and codebook usage (NWO-funded)
